## 1. Project Overview

Acne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatological conditions globally, yet its clinical assessment remains subject to high inter-observer variability. Traditional severity staging systems, such as the Investigators Global Assessment (IGA), rely on qualitative, holistic assessments that can lead to inconsistent diagnoses and subjective treatment decisions.

**QYRO Medical AI** is an experimental research project exploring how computer vision and hybrid reasoning can standardize acne lesion detection and stage severity. By combining **YOLO-based object detection** with a clinical reasoning layer, QYRO aims to deliver precise, explainable, and reproducible assessments.

### Key Focus Areas
* **Lesion-Level Detection:** Moving beyond image-level classification to localize and identify individual lesion subtypes (*Blackheads*, *Whiteheads*, *Papules*, *Pustules*, and *Cysts*).
* **Clinical Severity Staging:** Calibrating raw object detection bounding boxes with total surface area metrics to prevent macro close-up bias.
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** Presenting staging recommendations based on clinical rules rather than black-box decision boundaries.
* **Research-First Pipeline:** Standardizing data curation, provenance tracking, and annotation quality audits.

---

## 2. Current Research Focus

Our current research efforts are focused on the following areas:
* **Acne lesion detection:** Enhancing multi-class detection accuracy for dense, overlapping lesions.
* **Clinical dataset curation:** Auditing, cleaning, and labeling diverse dermatological image datasets.
* **Annotation quality assurance:** Identifying and removing labeling errors, noise, and out-of-boundary bounding boxes.
* **Explainable AI:** Structuring reasoning rules that map lesion distributions to severity stages transparently.
* **Dataset provenance:** Preserving tracking histories from raw source downloads to model-ready training partitions.
* **Severity assessment:** Normalizing counts by surface area to calibrate classification predictions.
* **Multi-source dataset harmonization:** Standardizing different class indexes, annotations, and aspect ratios from diverse sources.

## 3. Architecture

The QYRO Medical AI architecture separates raw image data ingestion, processing, and clinical staging into a structured research workflow:

         QYRO
```

## 4. Dataset Factory Pipeline

The QYRO Dataset Factory utilizes a strict, multi-stage processing pipeline to ensure data quality and integrity before model training:

```
  Raw Dataset
       │
       ▼
     Import
       │
       ▼
  Clinical Mapping
       │
       ▼
  Annotation Audit
       │
       ▼
  Quality Analysis
       │
       ▼
  YOLO Agreement Validation
       │
       ▼
    Deduplication
       │
       ▼
  Candidate Dataset
       │
       ▼
   Merged Dataset
       │
       ▼
    Training
```

* **Raw Dataset Ingestion:** Importing multi-source clinical and open-source datasets in native formats.
* **Annotation Audit:** Programmatic analysis of label counts, formatting errors, and boundary violations.
* **Clinical Mapping:** Standardizing class labels across different naming conventions (e.g., remapping generic labels to specific acne subtypes).
* **Quality Analysis:** Checking for corrupted images, color/exposure distribution anomalies, and resolution padding biases.
* **YOLO Agreement Validation:** Cross-checking training labels against pre-trained weights to flag extreme outlier annotations.
* **Deduplication:** Hashing files (using MD5) to identify and safely remove duplicate images, preventing data leakage between train/test splits.
* **Candidate Selection:** Retaining negative (background) samples to reduce False Positives while pruning noisy and unrelated classes.
* **Merged Dataset & Training:** Compiling clean, version-controlled records ready for YOLO training.

## 9. Medical AI Principles

Our development roadmap is guided by a set of core principles that prioritize patient safety and scientific rigor:

* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Designed to assist, not replace, dermatologists. Every automated triage recommendation points back to verifiable clinical staging criteria.
* **Dataset Provenance:** Ensuring full traceability of training images, from raw format to cleaned partitions, preventing opaque data bias.
* **Clinical Traceability:** Documenting exactly how AI-generated box densities map to severity categories (e.g., clear, comedonal, mild, moderate, severe).
* **Reproducibility:** Utilizing fixed seed counts, deterministic pipelines, and explicit augmentation constraints.
* **Responsible AI:** Restricting patient identifiers, filtering private metadata, and assessing skin tone and demographic representation to prevent diagnostic bias.
